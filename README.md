# Software-Development
My name is Emmanuel Humberset, I'm currently taking the Software Development program at Southwest Technical College.
This repository will be used to save assignments for the Software development class.
The reason I'm currently taking the software classes at Southwest Tech is because I need a skill that will allow me to have a more financially secured future. I've had a passion for technology my entire life, though I never believed that I would go into coding until recently. I've always been very interested in the hardware side of things, but not so much software development, and coding is very new to me.  My end goal with taking this program at Southwest tech is that I will have enough of a foundation of skills to continue to build upon in the foreseeable future, continue learning and practicing past the classes to become a better programmer, and in time, be employable. One of my best friends and also my earliest childhood friend is currently a game developer at SunnySide games in Switzerland, I aim to work with him on future projects for fun, and possibly more.
